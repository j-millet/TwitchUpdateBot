```
*help - yeah.
*showsubs - shows a list of subscriptions

*add <twitch username> - adds a user to subscriptions.
*remove <twitch username> - removes a user from subscriptions
*change_alert_channel - Changes the default channel alerts appear on.

If the bot doesn't send any alerts, despite subscribed users streaming it may not have the necessary permissions to do that. The default alert channel is the highest in UI view.
